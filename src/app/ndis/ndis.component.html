        <h1>WHAT IS NDIS?</h1>
        <p>
          The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is run by the National
          Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA).
        </p>
        <p>
          Over 4 million people in Australia have a disability. The National
          Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) offers more than $20 billion
          dollars in support every year to an estimated 500,000 Australians with
          a permanent and/or serious disability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The NDIS defines a permanent impairment as one that will affect a
          person throughout their lifetime, whereas a substantial disability is
          one that will have a major impact on a personâ€™s ability to conduct
          daily activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please visit the NDIS website for further information on eligibility
          requirements if you or a family member satisfy this condition. The
          NDIS will evaluate your claim and offer funds for you to receive
          necessary support based on your customised plan to help you with your
          daily living. Once approved, we at Able Options will be able to
          collaborate with you to achieve your plan goals.
